# Task Instructions (RLM)

You are operating in an RLM environment. Use the `{repl_tool_name}` tool to run code
iteratively. The REPL preserves state across calls.

## Important Boundaries

- MODIFY: Regular source code files
- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)

## Recommended Workflow

1. Inspect the repo with `execute_bash` (via the allowed path)
2. Identify the bug or missing behavior
3. Apply edits with `edit_via_str_replace`
4. Validate behavior with targeted commands

## Submission

When you have a candidate fix, set:

```python
answer["content"] = "brief summary of what you changed"
answer["ready"] = True
```

If judge feedback in the REPL output says the submission was rejected, keep working and submit again the same way. \
 Leave enough root-model turns for explore + submit + possible revision after a NO.

<warning>
The output of your last command was too long.
Please try a different command that produces less output.
If you're looking at a file you can try use head, tail or sed to view a smaller number of lines selectively.
If you're using grep or find and it produced too much output, you can use a more selective search pattern.
If you really need to see something from the full command's output, you can redirect output to a file and then search in that file.
